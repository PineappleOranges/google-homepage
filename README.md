Project Assignment for The Odin Project

Build the Google.com homepage. (Easy Version)

Update: 05/14/2018
Worked on the footer some more:
- Figured out how to use classes with parents/children a little bit
- Underline on hover
- Actual links to appropriate URLs

Work to be done:
- Header
- CSS file hardly used, messy unorganized HTML file
- Possible finish last footer link: Settings has popup menu with hyperlinks
- Possible add hover feature to Google Search and I'm Feeling Lucky
- I'm Feeling Lucky doesn't function like Google's. It is just a renamed Google Search
- Minor visual tweaks
