Project Assignment for The Odin Project

Build the Google.com homepage. (Easy Version)

Work to be done:
- Sign in button is misaligned for some reason. Tired of working on this page, so 
    I'm going to consider this finished.
- CSS file hardly used, messy unorganized HTML file
- Possible finish last footer link: Settings has popup menu with hyperlinks
- Possible add hover feature to Google Search and I'm Feeling Lucky
- I'm Feeling Lucky doesn't function like Google's. It is just a renamed Google Search
- Minor visual tweaks
